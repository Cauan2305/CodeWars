# CodeWars Exercises

Welcome to my repository of solutions for exercises from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/).

## About the Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions for challenges found on CodeWars. Each solution is organized in folders according to the difficulty level (kyu) of the challenge.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── 8-kyu/
│   ├── challenge-name-1/
│   │   ├── solution.js
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── challenge-name-2/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 7-kyu/
│   ├── ...
└── ...
```

## How to Use

To view a solution, navigate to the folder corresponding to the difficulty level and then to the name of the challenge. Each challenge has a solution file (for example, `solution.js` or `solution.py`) and a `README.md` with the problem description.

## Contributions

This repository is personal and reflects my individual solutions for the challenges. However, if you have any suggestions or corrections, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
